# Unix Exercise

Consider the following series of terminal commands.
```bash
> mkdir farm
> cd farm
> mkdir barn
> mkdir pasture
> cd pasture
> mkdir cows
> mkdir goats
> mkdir sheep
> cd ..
> cd barn
> mkdir chickens
> mkdir pigs
> mkdir stables
> cd stables
> mkdir horses
> cd ..
> cd ..
> pwd
```

1. What is the directory structure after these commands are executed?

2. What is the path to the folder pigs/?
